Data Visualization for Businesses
===============

This repository is a store for all materials associated with the General Assembly class [Data Visualization for Businesses](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-visualization-for-businesses-understanding-dashboards-and-metrics-displays/new-york-city/3815). 

If you are a member of one of the classes, I am going to maintain this page indefinitely. I hope that you find it a hepful reference in the future.

### Part 1 ###

In class, I gave examples of two interactive visualizations, one on the US banking system [using d3](jlaurito.github.io/us_bank_map/mapping_us_banks.html), and one on startup revenue using the [Google Viz API](http://blog.joshlaurito.com/inc5000.html). You can see either using the links above: the codebases are [here (d3)](https://github.com/jlaurito/jlaurito.github.io/tree/master/us_bank_map) and [here (Google Viz)](https://github.com/jlaurito/inc5000).

I also point you to the [SEC filings site](http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). Look for S-1s and 10-Ks!


### Part 2 ###

There are lots of good resources on Visualization. I pointed you to four of the experts: here are quick links to books or online resources of each.

[Jacques Bertin's book](http://www.amazon.com/Semiology-Graphics-Diagrams-Networks-Maps/dp/1589482611)
[Edward Tufte's books](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_visex)
[Tamara Munzner's presentation](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/talks/vizbi11/vizbi11.pdf)
[One of Mike Bostock's many presentations](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/cubism/intro/#0)

### Part 3 ###

If you want to dig more into the Twitter data here's the [S-1](http://1.usa.gov/19x3tcv) and here's the [spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/1ajvnYn). If you don't like google docs, there's a spreadsheet above.

### Part 4 ###

The sample real-time data is at http://bit.ly/15IaSq4. It's a little (ok, a lot) hack-y and only runs for 5min(ish) at a time due to google rules about long-running macros. It's really just for a simple example.
